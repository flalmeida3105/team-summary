## Purpose
An app that lets you build a quick website with all your employees separated by color, with the darkest quadrant to display the managers and the brightest quadrant to display the interns. 


## General Information
Currently, there is no application on the market that can quickly and effectively build a website based on the information provided by the user, and that meets all my needs. 

Based on that, this app was built to close this gap, as well as to speed up the creation of an overview of all employees in a centralized location.
